#Sudoku - Web Version
==================

This is my fifth week project at Makers Academy. 
The app allows you to play sudoku online.
The exercise involves basic math logic, object-oriented-programming, knowledge of strings, arrays and hashes, knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3.

This project is our first project that will be uploaded to the web using Heroku. The main aim is to build a greater understanding of the practical application of Ruby code in a live web setting.

My sudoku app is available [here] (http://my-sudoku.herokuapp.com). Hope you enjoy it!
